## Priority
- use icons for workspace names, hide the solid empty space in the middle of the bar
	- e.g.: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinlatrille/dots-solarized/master/screenshots/screenshot-dunst.png

## General computing
- text mail client (neomutt?)
- time syncing (setup NTP client or something)

## Dev
- python project template
	- including gitignore and vscode
- bin/install_vscode_extensions (https://github.com/victorhmp/dotfiles/blob/master/vscode-extensions-install.sh)
	- for now I track them in ~/notes/vscode_extensions.md

## Quality of life
- set dark mode on sunset: https://gitlab.com/WhyNotHugo/darkman/
	- TODO: use it to trigger dark/light mode toggles for all the software
- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dark_mode_switching
	- also: show what mode I'm in, switch modes (show in something like neofetch? or in some statusbar-like thing?) 

## Visual niceness
- bash config (perhaps I'll switch to nushell though)
- terminal config (move from alacritty to st?)
- solarize everything (perhaps some other color schemes too? like gruvbox, zenburn)
- beautiful font which is comfortable for my eyes (try out ligatures too?)


## Workstation setup
- arch install script
- cleaning installed arch from unwanted packages
	- ideally being able to revert it back to the state of a fresh install
- (dot)files and folders cleanup (like ayekat's dotbloat script)


## Research
- XDG directory convention
	- https://github.com/ayekat/dotfiles
	- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory


# Interesting things to explore

- try out orgmode
- using dmenu menus for common tasks or things like that
